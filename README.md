# Finite Automaton Implementation

This project contains the implementation of a finite automaton and a pushdown automaton. The finite automaton manages a regular language, transitioning through states based on input characters. The pushdown automaton evaluates strings of `0`s and `1`s to determine if they belong to a specific context-free language.

## Compilation

To compile this project, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed and run the following command:

```bash
g++ -o automaton main.cpp
